prereqs
	- validate hilo RSA in each task
		- prewhitening and cross-validated simil
		- determine target TRs


1. static
2. time-resolved


'STATIC' ANALYSIS: COMPARE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS

for each task:

	1. assemble contrast array per ROI (average across target TRs)

	2. calculate fingerprint distance, full dimensionality
		* prew euclidean distance
		-> impact of prewhitening on coverage (do with raw)?
		-> impact of standardization on coverage (do with correlation)?
		
	3. calculate fingerprint distance, single dimension
		* prew euclidean distance
		-> impact of prewhitening on coverage (do with raw)?
	
	4. calculate fingerprint distance, increasing dimensionality
