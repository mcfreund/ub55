transients 
	- reflect presence of signal
		- collinearity? oscillations in pseudoinverse?
	- enhanced by blockONandOFF regressor in residualizing model
		- additional transients on rest beg, rest end, task beg, task end
	- eliminated by eliminating residualizing model: 
		- without residualization, projections reflect true signal

1. examine non-residualized
	- what are oscillations (esp. Axcpt, Cts, Stern)?

try residualized first
	- exclude block transitions, first rest, first/last few frames
	- need to re-center at cutpoint
	- cross-task

if no luck, can try non-residualized (null)
	- but need to determine what are oscillations in null
