preparation

	- details: runwise, 1trpk somehow ('old' style or iresp trfm), appropriate block regressor (and block on off)
	- alternate (t*hilo) structures for stroop, cts?
		- trial balancing?
		- VIFs?
	- n nuisance regressors:
		- decode task info from derivs? more stringent scrubbing?
	- final check:
		- VIFs, trial balancing, decode info.



validation
	
	- univariate stats, reliability
